# logo-design-assignment

for my project I chose to make a logo for the cupcake business from the moodboard assignment. To expand the cupcake business further I chose to make the owner my dogs name (Aelin) and chose to make the logo background a cloud with sprinkles to create a dream-like aspect.

I changed the colors of the designs to be the same blue shades as the moodboard and added a contrasting pink colorto the text.
